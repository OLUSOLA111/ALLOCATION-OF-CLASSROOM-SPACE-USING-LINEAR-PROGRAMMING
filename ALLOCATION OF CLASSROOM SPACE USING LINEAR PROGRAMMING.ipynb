    "The use of linear programming to solve the problem of over-allocation and under-allocation of scarce classroom space was\n",
    "considered with reference to the engineering building at the university of calgary. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the school management has reduced the number of students that can make use a class for a particular course to thirty students (30) per class and since we have ten classes, the total number of students that can make use of the classes shouldn't be greater than three hundred (300) but the management gave an exception to classes that have higher seating capacity allowing them to accomodate up to seventy students (70).Research was done and data was collected from the University's website on the classroom facilities in the engineering building and the number of engineering students per-course. Assuming five major engineering programmes are considered and the classroom spaces are assigned to one undergraduate course and one masters course. A linear programming model was formulated based on the data collected to maximize the usage of the classroom space. Python with the aid of jupyter notebook was used based on the simplex algorithm, revised simplex algorithm and Pulp library to obtain optimal solution. \n",
    "Analysis of the result showed that one thousand and twenty five (1025) seats can be used by the students for their classes following the social distancing rules making the total number of students using the ten(10) classrooms to be three hundred in total (300). It was also observed that only seven out of the ten classrooms were assigned to students which means that the classrooms that were not assigned can be assigned to other students in other deparment instead of leaving them idle or the management can reduce the number of students intake during the COVID-19 pandemic if the classes in the engineering building are meant for one course in undergrad and one graduate course to maximize their profit margin."

    " The problem of allocation of scarce resource to satisfy unlimited human needs has been and will continue to be a global phenomenon confronting managers, administrators, entrepreneurs, head of institutions and individuals alike.\n",
    "\n",
    " Space allocation can be defined as the allocation of resources to areas such as rooms, satisfying as many requirements and constraints as possible. Space allocation as a process of allocating rooms or areas of space for specific purpose[1]. Thus, since it is limited it must be well managed by the faculty towards availability and suitability for the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, Classroom Space Allocation refers to the effective distribution of the available areas of classroom space among a number of engineering majors with different sizes of student population so as to ensure optimal space utilization and the satisfaction of additional requirements and/or constraints. In this generic case, an important \n",
    "condition exists: the areas of space that can be used and the space required by the entities are not subject to \n",
    "modification. The ideal solution in the space allocation problem is one where all the entities are allocated, no \n",
    "space is wasted or overused and every additional requirements and constraints have been satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "A procedure for allocating classrooms in an is based on a linear programming model in which a penalty function is minimized[2]. With the \n",
    "default values of some parameters provided by the procedure, the model first assigns as many real rooms to the \n",
    "requests as possible. It also seeks to do so with the most preferred rooms. Finally, when it is necessary to depart \n",
    "from the most preferred rooms to satisfy the first objective, the model attempts to spread this departure \n",
    "uniformly among requests. By altering the default values in the penalty function, the user may also favor some \n",
    "requests in the attribution of rooms. Constraints are concerned with the availability of rooms at various hours of \n",
    "the day, and with the requests for these rooms. They stated emphatically that since this approach implicitly \n",
    "explores all possible assignments, it should produce better results than manual allocation. Results of empirical \n",
    "applications confirmed these expectations, taking the number of demands that can be met as the main criterion. \n",
    "Moreover, an automated procedure to prepare the problem and decipher a dolution has made it possible to \n",
    "decrease substantially the time spent on this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the mission of the engineering faculty at the university of calgary, classroom resources \n",
    "are primarily for use by students, and staff for educational activities and programs that are directly related to the \n",
    "functions of teaching, research, and scholarly production. Every effort is always made by the University to ensure \n",
    "that classrooms are assigned fairly and used appropriately to accommodate the University's academic and \n",
    "instructional needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to consistently and effectively allocate classrooms is to use a computer-assisted system that will keep track of all classrooms in the engineering building along with specific details about those rooms that can automatically suggest efficient pairings with the courses offered for a given semester[3]. The \n",
    "efficiency will be judged based on many factors, most importantly being that the size of each room is used \n",
    "effectively. Studies were make by researchers about assigning a number of courses to classrooms taking into consideration constraints like classroom capacities[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mathematical programming that solves the problem of determining the \n",
    "optimal allocation of limited resources required to meet a given objective is the linear programming, a method \n",
    "of allocating limited resources to competing needs in the best way in order to ensure optimality[5]. Linear \n",
    "programming deals with optimization problems where both the objective function to be optimized and all\n",
    "constraints are linear in terms of decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear programming (LP)  or Linear Optimisation may be defined as the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function that is subjected to linear constraints. The constraints may be equalities or inequalities. The optimisation problems involve the calculation of profit and loss.  Linear programming problems are an important class of optimisation problems, that helps to find the feasible region and optimise the solution in order to have the highest or lowest value of the function[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, linear programming is considered as an optimization method to maximize or minimize the objective function of the given mathematical model with the set of some requirements which are represented in the linear relationship. The main aim of the linear programming problem is to find the optimal solution. The linear programming problem can be solved using different methods, such as the graphical method, simplex method, or by using tools such as R, open solver etc. Here, we will use the most important technique called the simplex method.\n",

    "From the result gotten above after fifteen iterations; it can be observed that seven(7) out of the ten(10) classrooms were assigned to students following the rules by the management on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "We can observe that all classrooms were used to provide a seating capacity of one thousand and twenty five (1025) to accomodate the student population as a result of the pandemic.\n",
    "The total classroom space (optimal solution) of one thousand and fifteen was obtained thus:\n",
    "(154 * 1) + (148 * 1) + (334 * 1) + (18 * 0) + (105 * 0.54545455) + (140 * 1) + (147 * 1) + (65 * 0) + (65 * 0) + (30 * 1) = 1025\n",
    "\n",
    "Seven out of the ten classrooms were utilized to provide a space of one thousand and fifteen (1015) for the three hundred students(300) following the rule of social distancing.\n",
    "From above; considering the global optimal solution gotten since the objective and constraints are convex, we can imply that classroom type one($T_1$) consisting of undergraduate students taking ENCH 315 were fully assigned, classroom type two($T_2$) consisting of graduate students taking ENCH 677 was fully assigned, classroom type three($T_3$) consisting of students taking ENCI 300 was fully assigned, classroom type four($T_4$) consisting of students taking ENCI 715 was not assigned because the number of students taking the course is grater than the total number of seats in the class, classroom type 5($T_5$) consisting of students taking ENEL 201 was partially assigned because the number of students taking the course is a little more than the number of seats we have in the class. Therefore, classroom type 5 was assigned 57(fifty seven) students which means that the management can reduce the number of student intake into the course to approximately half of what it is now. classroom type six($T_6$) consisting of students taking ENEL 601 was fully assigned to students, classroom type seven($T_7$) consisting of students taking ENGO 333 was fully assigned to students, classroom type eight($T_8$) consisting of students taking ENGO 675 was  not assigned because the classroom didn't meet the course specification which implies that the number of students were greater than the number of seats in the classroom. Classroom type nine($T_9$) consisting of students enrolled in ENME 101 was not also assigned because it doesn't meet the course specifications, classroom type ten ($T_10$) consisting of students enrolled in ENME 708 was fully assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication of this findings is that only seven out of the ten classrooms were assigned to students which means that the classrooms that were not assigned can be assigned to other students in other deparment instead of leaving them idle or the management can reduce the number of students intake during the COVID-19 pandemic if the classes in the engineering building are meant for one course in undergrad and one graduate course to maximize their profit margin."
